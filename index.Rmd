I am a postgraduate student in the University of Glasgow's
[Institute of Neuroscience and Psychology](http://www.gla.ac.uk/researchinstitutes/neurosciencepsychology/) working with [Lisa Debruine](http://facelab.org/People/debruine).

My current work focuses on the influence of sexual orientation and parental imprinting on partner choice and is part of the KINSHIPproject. 
You can find out about all of my projects in the [Research](research.html) tab.
